Sessions are server-side files which contain user information
A session ends when a user closes his browser
In PHP, before using $_SESSION, you have to write session_start(); Likewise for other languages
Within-session you can store as much data as you like. 
The only limits you can reach is the maximum memory a script can consume at one time, which is 128MB by default
A session is dependent on Cookie
Session_destroy(); is used to destroy all registered data or to unset some
